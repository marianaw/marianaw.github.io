I recently obtained my PhD degree from Inria and Université de Lille where I worked at the [Magnet team](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/magnet) under the supervision of [Pascal Denis](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~pdenis/about_me.html)
and [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/). My PhD work is mainly focused in Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning under topology uncertainty.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at
Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía y Física (FaMAF),
Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina, in October of 2013, and shortly after I enrolled in an
Applied Statistics Master program which I almost finished (pending defense).
