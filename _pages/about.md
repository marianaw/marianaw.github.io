I am a fourth year PhD student at the [Magnet team](https://www.inria.fr/equipes/magnet) at Inria Lille Nord Europe adviced by [Pascal Denis](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/~pdenis/about_me.html) (advisor)
and [Aurélien Bellet](http://researchers.lille.inria.fr/abellet/) (co-advisor). My work is mainly focused in Graph-based Machine Learning with applications in
Natural Language Processing.

Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science at
Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía y Física (FaMAF),
Universidad Nacional de Córdoba, Argentina, in October of 2013, and shortly after I enrolled in an
Applied Statistics Master program which I almost finished (pending defense).
