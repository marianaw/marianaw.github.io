Work experience
======

* Jan 2016- July 2016: Graduate Research Intern, Xerox Research Centre Europe, Grenoble.
  I joined Parsing and Semantics group at XRCE as a Graduate Research Intern to work

  the problem of information extraction in ”noisy“ natural language sentences.
  Graphical models and CRFs were crucial for the project, nevertheless we also studied
  multi-label classification with a large amount of labels. At the final stage of my internship I
  had the chance to work on deep learning with Theano and Keras.
